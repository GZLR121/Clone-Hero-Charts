loading_phrase = There’s one ballad, and it’s very intense in concept. It’s about prejudiced relationships, a Catholic and a Protestant that can never be together in Ireland. It could be a metaphor to interracial marriages, it could be about same-sex marriages, it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can’t be together in this life, maybe we’ll make it in the next.
